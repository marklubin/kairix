# Claude's Work Diary - Entry 2: Core Infrastructure

**Date**: 2025-01-06
**Task**: Create core module structure and base component interfaces

## Summary

Built the foundational architecture for the new modular system:

### Module Structure Created
- `apiana/core/` - Main business logic module
- `apiana/core/components/` - Pipeline component base classes
- `apiana/core/pipelines/` - Pipeline orchestration
- `apiana/core/providers/` - LLM and embedding providers  
- `apiana/core/services/` - High-level business services

### Base Component System
Created a robust component interface with:
- `Component` - Abstract base class for all pipeline stages
- `ComponentResult` - Standardized result format with data, metadata, errors
- Specialized base classes: `Reader`, `Processor`, `Writer`, `Chunker`
- Built-in validation, error handling, and timing

### Conversation Chunking Service
Implemented sophisticated chunking logic that:
- Uses transformers tokenizer for accurate token counting
- Respects message boundaries (won't split mid-message)
- Handles edge cases like oversized single messages
- Uses naming convention: `${title}_01`, `_02`, etc.
- Provides detailed statistics about chunking results
- Falls back gracefully when transformers unavailable

## Technical Decisions

1. **Component Result Pattern**: Standardized return format ensures consistent error handling across all components
2. **Token Counting Strategy**: Primary uses transformers tokenizer, fallback to char-based estimation
3. **Chunk Naming**: Sequential numbering preserves relationship to original conversation
4. **Message Boundary Preservation**: Never splits messages in the middle to maintain readability

## Challenges Solved

- **Large Message Handling**: Created intelligent splitting that looks for natural boundaries (paragraphs, sentences)
- **Tokenizer Compatibility**: Added fallback mechanism for when transformers isn't available
- **Metadata Preservation**: Ensures chunk metadata correctly maps to original conversation metadata

## Files Created
- `apiana/core/__init__.py` - Core module initialization
- `apiana/core/components/base.py` - Component base classes and interfaces
- `apiana/core/services/chunking.py` - Conversation chunking service
- `claudes_notes/02_core_infrastructure.md` - This diary entry

## Next Steps

The foundation is solid. Ready to build reader and processor components on top of this infrastructure. The component interface will make it easy to create clean, testable pipeline stages.
