# Claude's Work Diary - Entry 1: Planning Phase

**Date**: 2025-01-06
**Task**: Create comprehensive implementation plan

## Summary

Today I created a comprehensive plan for migrating the Apiana AI project from custom Pydantic models to using the chatformat library. The user wants a significant architectural refactoring that includes:

1. Separating business logic from UI components
2. Using neo4j-graphrag patterns for modular processing
3. Implementing conversation chunking (5000 token limit)
4. Adding a local LLM provider using transformers
5. Creating proper test coverage

## Key Decisions Made

- **Module Structure**: Decided to create a new `apiana/core/` module to house all business logic, keeping the UI layer thin in `applications/`
- **Component Pattern**: Using a base `Component` class with standardized interfaces for all pipeline stages
- **Chunking Strategy**: Will respect message boundaries while staying under token limits, using naming convention `${title}_01`, `_02`, etc.
- **Testing Approach**: Three-tier testing (unit, integration, e2e) to ensure quality

## Challenges Identified

1. Need to maintain backward compatibility during migration
2. Token counting must be accurate for chunking
3. Local LLM provider needs to match OpenAI interface
4. Pipeline visualization in Gradio requires careful design

## Next Steps

Starting with creating the core module structure and base component interfaces. This foundation will enable clean, testable code for all subsequent work.

The plan is ambitious but well-structured. Ready to begin implementation!
